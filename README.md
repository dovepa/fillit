# Fillit Project

Welcome to the Fillit project at 42! This project is an introduction to algorithmic thinking and coding in C.

The goal of Fillit is to create a program that takes a set of tetrominoes and finds the smallest possible square that can fit them all. You will use algorithms such as backtracking and recursion to solve this challenge.

By working on this project, you will learn important coding skills such as:
- Memory management
- Error handling
- File handling
- Algorithm optimization

Additionally, you will gain experience working with a team, as the Fillit project is done in pairs.

We encourage you to take your time with this project and focus on writing clean and efficient code. The Fillit project will provide you with a great opportunity to develop your coding skills and grow as a programmer.

So let's get started and tackle the challenge of Fillit!
